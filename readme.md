USERNAME @MENTIONS
Typing an @ symbol, followed by
a username, will notify that person
to come and view the comment.
This is called an “@mention”,
because you’re mentioning the
individual. You can also @mention
teams within an organization.

FENCED CODE BLOCKS
```javascript
function test() {
 console.log("look ma’, no spaces");
}
```
Markdown coverts text with four leading spaces into a code block; with GFM you can
wrap your code with ``` to create a code block without the leading spaces. Add an
optional language identifier and your code will get syntax highlighting.
function test() {
 console.log("look ma’, no spaces");
}
